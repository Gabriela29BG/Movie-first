### Development Experience

#### Cryptocurrency Visualization Platform

I developed a comprehensive platform for visualizing cryptocurrencies, highlighting exchange rates and providing key information about different coins. Here are the key aspects of the development:

- **Attractive Visual Design:** Employed an appealing color palette, with orange tones representing cryptocurrencies and soft blues for highlighting essential information.

- **Intuitive User Interface:** Designed a user-friendly interface with well-defined sections, offering users a clear experience when exploring exchange rates and coin details.

- **Responsiveness:** The platform is fully responsive, ensuring an optimal experience on both mobile and desktop devices.

- **Automatic Updates:** Implemented an automatic update feature to keep exchange rate information always up-to-date, enhancing the utility of the service.

- **Technical Details:** Used HTML, CSS (with the "DM Sans" Google font), and JavaScript to achieve interactivity and dynamic data visualization. Integrated shadows and visual effects to enhance presentation.

- **Subscription Plans Section:** Developed a subscription plans section with prominent cards, displaying annual prices with discounts and recommended options.

This project showcases my ability to create comprehensive web solutions, from real-time data visualization to the implementation of interactive features, with a focus on aesthetic design and user experience.
